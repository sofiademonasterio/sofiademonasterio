## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am SofÃ­a! 
I am a junior software developer with foundational knowledge in databases and front-end development. I am eager to expand my skills and gain practical experience in the field. I have a solid understanding of fundamental database concepts, such as data modeling, querying, and basic database administration.

In terms of front-end development, I have a good grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enables me to create and style basic web pages. I am familiar with modern front-end frameworks like React and Nextjs, and I have worked on small projects utilizing these technologies.

As a junior developer, I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends. I am a quick learner, detail-oriented, and thrive in a collaborative environment. I am eager to contribute to the success of projects and continue honing my skills as a software developer.
