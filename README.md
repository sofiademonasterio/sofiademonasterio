## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am SofÃ­a! 
As a junior software developer, I have basic knowledge in databases and front-end development. I'm eager to learn and gain practical experience in the field. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and familiar with React, Nextjs and Angular. I'm detail-oriented, a quick learner, and thrive in collaborative environments. Excited to contribute and grow as a developer.
